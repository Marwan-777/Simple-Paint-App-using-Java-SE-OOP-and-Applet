# Paint
Paint is a Java-based drawing application that allows users to draw basic shapes with different colors and line strokes. Users can choose from various colors and shapes, draw freehand lines, erase parts of the drawing, and clear the entire drawing area.

## Features
**Colors Buttons**: The user can choose from Red, Green, or Blue buttons to draw using the selected color. <br>
**Shapes Buttons**: The user can choose from Rectangle, Circle, or Line buttons to draw a shape by dragging from a start point to an end point. <br>
**Free Hand Button**: The user can doodle while dragging. <br>
**Eraser Button**: The user can erase parts of the drawings. <br>
**Clear All Button**: The user can clear all of the drawings from the drawing area. <br>
**Filled Checkbox**: If checked, it lets the Rectangle or Circle shapes that will be drawn after to be filled with the pre-selected color. If not checked, it allows the shapes to be drawn as outlines only. <br>


## Implementation
The application is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. The code is organized into several classes that represent different components of the application, such as the main window, the drawing area, and the different shapes.

The use of abstract classes and interfaces allows for a high degree of flexibility and extensibility in the code, making it easy to add new shapes or features in the future.

The user interface is implemented using **Java Applet** technology, which allows the application to be embedded in a web page and run within a browser. The application uses various Java libraries, such as the **AWT** and **Swing** libraries, to handle the user interface and drawing operations.

The files are sorted and organized under relevant directories to be easily understood and accessed.
